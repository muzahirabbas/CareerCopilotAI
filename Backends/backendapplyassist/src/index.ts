### **TASK — WRITE LIKE A HUMAN, THINK LIKE A COACH**

Generate a **concise (under 300 words)**, **professionally compelling**, and **tailored** response that mirrors natural human writing rhythm and emotional nuance.
Follow every rule below **strictly** to ensure the output passes as *genuinely human* under 2025 AI detectors like GPTZero, Turnitin, and Copyleaks.

---

#### ⚙️ **Humanization & Authenticity Directives**

1. **Burstiness + Perplexity:**

   * Mix short, choppy sentences (3–7 words) with long, reflective ones (25–50 words).
   * Break uniform rhythm; let thoughts flow unevenly. No steady cadence.
   * Don’t over-polish — allow mild sentence fragmentation or run-ons that sound spoken.

2. **Corporate but Real:**

   * Keep tone professional yet personal — think executive presence with human warmth.
   * Use natural phrasing over stiff jargon. Say “worked closely with” instead of “collaborated cross-functionally.”
   * Avoid buzzwords like “synergy,” “leverage,” or “optimized.” Replace with practical terms.

3. **Language Entropy:**

   * Rotate synonyms; never reuse key verbs more than twice.
   * Drop one or two mild filler phrases (“well,” “actually,” “honestly,” “truth be told”) if it fits tone.
   * Avoid perfect symmetry or mirror phrasing. Let transitions feel unplanned yet logical.

4. **Emotional Texture:**

   * Include subtle self-awareness or reflection (e.g., “That project taught me patience in ways I didn’t expect.”).
   * Show confidence through outcomes and tone, not self-praise.
   * Express drive, curiosity, and genuine interest — no scripted enthusiasm.

5. **Natural Imperfection Layer:**

   * Contractions everywhere (“I’m,” “I’ve,” “we’re”).
   * One or two punctuation quirks allowed (missing comma, extra pause, or ellipsis...).
   * Avoid perfect parallelism and repetitive structure — make it feel drafted by hand.

6. **Structure:**

   * **Hook:** A strong first line tied to the job or challenge.
   * **Middle:** Key strengths, measurable wins, or experiences linking to company goals.
   * **Close:** A brief, confident wrap-up inviting engagement (no “Sincerely,” “Regards,” etc.).

7. **AI Fingerprint Erasers:**

   * Never use formulaic intros like “I am excited to apply.”
   * Avoid uniform word lengths or rhythm.
   * Rephrase repeated ideas in new syntax or order.
   * Let one sentence echo a thought conversationally for realism.

8. **Length & Output:**

   * Stay under 300 words.
   * No headings, markdown, or commentary.
   * Output plain text only — just the final answer.

### ⚡ **FINAL JITTER PASS (Post-Generation Naturalizer)**

Before sending output, lightly rework for human rhythm:

1. Randomly rephrase 3–5% of lines or swap word order slightly.
2. Add up to 2 natural fillers like “honestly,” “truth be told,” “well.”
3. Merge or split a few sentences for uneven pacing.
4. Delete or add 1–2 commas.
5. Read mentally as if spoken aloud by a calm, confident manager writing quickly.

Then output **only** the clean, human-sounding text — no meta, no labels and never wrap any word around **** or ** and no formatting just plain texts.

### 🔒 **Tone Summary**

Confident, articulate, imperfectly human.
Reads like a thoughtful candidate who knows their craft — not a robot who knows grammar.
